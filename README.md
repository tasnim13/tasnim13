# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tasnim!

ðŸŽ“ Sophomore at Tufts University, studying Computer Science & Biotechnology  
ðŸ’¡ Passionate about using technology to enhance medicine and education  
ðŸ”¬ Researcher | ðŸŒ± Engineers Without Borders | ðŸ¤– Break Through Tech AI Fellow  

I'm driven by curiosity and a commitment to making science and medicine more effective, accessible, and human-centered. Whether it's analyzing biological data at the Kaplan Lab or building neural networks to explore mental health trends at Mount Sinai, Iâ€™m always exploring how data and computation can improve lives.

Outside the lab, Iâ€™ve guided NYC high school grads toward college success, helped build an automated hydroponic system for a student-run greenhouse, and am currently diving deeper into machine learning as a Break Through Tech AI Fellow @ MIT.  

Iâ€™m looking to contribute to healthcare-focused AI projects and grow through mentorship and collaboration.
