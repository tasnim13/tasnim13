# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tasnim!

ðŸŽ“ Sophomore at Tufts University, studying Computer Science & Biotechnology  
ðŸ’¡ Passionate about using technology to enhance medicine and education  
ðŸ”¬ Researcher | ðŸŒ± Engineers Without Borders | ðŸ¤– Break Through Tech AI Fellow  

I'm driven by curiosity and a commitment to making science and medicine more effective, accessible, and human-centered. Whether it's analyzing biological data at the Kaplan Lab or building neural networks to explore mental health trends at Mount Sinai, Iâ€™m always exploring how data and computation can improve lives.

Outside the lab, Iâ€™ve guided NYC high school grads toward college success, helped build an automated hydroponic system for a student-run greenhouse, and am currently diving deeper into machine learning as a Break Through Tech AI Fellow @ MIT.  

Iâ€™m looking to contribute to healthcare-focused AI projects and grow through mentorship and collaboration.

## ðŸš€ Projects

**Hydroponics Automation System**  
Built a fully automated watering and nutrient regulation system for a student-run greenhouse using Arduino.  
*Skills:* Hardware programming, sustainability tech, teamwork  

**Mental Health Sensor Data Analysis**  
Used smartphone sensor data and machine learning to study the relationship between physical activity and MDD symptoms.  
*Skills:* Clustering, neural networks, Python, independent research  

checkout my exploratory model building to predict diagnostic groups of patients based on ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data: [Group Prediction Model](https://github.com/tasnim13/diagnostic_group_prediction_model)

Check out this model for predicting hapiness! I clustered countries based on their similar profiles using an unsuperivised model and then used that clustering information as an additional feature to predict life ladder or happiness scores of a country: [Predicting Happiness](https://github.com/tasnim13/Happiness_Predictor)

Check out this program for nutrition scores for popular commercial food products: [Nutriscore]()
